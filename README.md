# Cheap Publish

Yet another open source alternative to Obsidian Publish.

Forked from:
- https://github.com/Yarden-zamir/obsidian-zola-plus
- https://github.com/rockmanvnx6/obsidian-zola
- https://github.com/ppeetteerrs/obsidian-zola

See `Yarden-zamir/obsidian-zola-plus`'s [README](https://github.com/Yarden-zamir/obsidian-zola-plus) for more details on how to use.

Visit https://garden.nevek.co/improvements-to-cheap-publish/ for more details about the changes made in this fork, or better: read the code if you can. I wouldn't advise it as a drop-in replacement for an existing obsidian-zola setup since this fork removes the `/docs` part that was prepended to all URLs for some reason.
